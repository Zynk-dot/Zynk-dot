# 👋 Welcome, wanderer

I'm **@Zynk-dot** —  
I make tools that whisper in terminals, speak with your voice, and sometimes… watch back.  

---

### ⚙️ What I build
- 🧠 **AI-powered agents** (yes, they hear you)
- 🌍 **Geolocation visualizers** (trace routes in real-time)
- 🗣️ **Voice-activated interfaces** (talk to your OS like a hacker)
- 🔐 **Security-inspired experiments** (the clean ones… for now)

---

### 🌱 Currently
- Training tiny transformers to *predict* the future  
- Embedding AI into scripts, shells, and silence  
- Automating weird stuff just to see if I can  

---

### 🛰️ I like tools that:
- run fast  
- look simple  
- feel smart  
- and don’t ask for permission
